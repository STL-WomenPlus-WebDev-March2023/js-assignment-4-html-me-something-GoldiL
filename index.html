               <p>
                  Our summer vacation started with our trip to Texas via road.
   TEXAS is the second largest US state.Texas shares borders with the states of
   Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest; and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.
   We planned to visit our cousins who stay in Dallas and also our friends family who stays in Austin. We also planned to go to south padre island which South Padre Island.

               <p>
                  South Padre Island is a resort town in Cameron County,
                  Texas, United States.This small town is an ironic 
                   to the old saying that "everything is bigger in Texas." The clear waters and white sand beaches of this coastal paradise are more than a match for many of the world's top seaside destinations.
                  It was a break away from everyday .
                  We stayed at the Seagal resorts which we booked via air bnb.
                  The house was just beach facing which made our stay more fun.
                   My friends family of five and our family of four stayed there for four days.There were three kids and an infant who were super excited after seeing the beach from our home.

               <p>We visited two cousins who stay at Dallas.It was pleasure visiting them and the kids came to know about their cousins.Luckily both the cousins had boys who wer around the same age as my kids.So they played with cars, scooter, tag and board game.They even created some good portraits and had fun coloring.We went to a famous Indian restaurant in Dallas named Kumars and ate some delicious food.It was refreshing to have been on the trip.Though the travel back home felt long,we were missing to be back at our nest.The road trip was pleasant we saw cattles all over Oklahoma and the beautiful road through Spring field.
